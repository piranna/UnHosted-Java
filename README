This is just a little Java (Android) implementation/port of the UnHosted client
protocol based on Javascript one and the "My Favourite Sandwich" demo app
(https://github.com/michiel-unhosted/myfavouritesandwich).

It's far from perfect, but since i have to learn Java for my OOP exams and i
wanted to learn Android and wanted to collaborate with UnHosted, what's the best
thing that do the three things at the same time? :-)

At this moment it only have Android Eclipse SDK proyect files with "tunned" UI,
no more.
