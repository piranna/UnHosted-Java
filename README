This is just a little Java (Android) implementation/port of the UnHosted client
protocol based on Javascript one and the "My Favourite Sandwich" demo app
(https://github.com/unhosted/unhosted).

It's far from perfect, but since i have to learn Java for my OOP exams and i
wanted to learn Android and wanted to collaborate with UnHosted, what's the best
thing that do the three things at the same time? :-)

At this moment it only have Android Eclipse SDK proyect files with "tunned" UI,
no more. It require to have linked the com.google.gson package to deserialize the stored data to Java objects.
